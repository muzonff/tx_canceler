# tx_canceler
Cancel unconfirmed TX

With main.py file you can create ANY transaction (even 100000 USDTs) and it will hang as outgoing (recipient's wallet must be exodus, then he will see this transaction). GENERAL: specify the commission with which the transaction 100% will not go through

With the help of repl.py you can cancel the created transaction. The commission should be specified as usual for the network

The scripts work in many ERC-like networks
